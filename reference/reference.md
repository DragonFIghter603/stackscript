# Reference
###### Go back to [README](../README.md).
The reference will be providing screenshots instead of plain text due to this langage not being supported by
github's markdown code highlighter, unless its only a few symbols. Longer pieces of code will include a text version to copy from.

- Read more about how the language works, the general [syntax and builtin functions](reference/structure_syntax_builtins.md)
- Read about [modules](reference/variables_modules.md)
