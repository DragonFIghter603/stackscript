#<a id="top"/>Program Flow
###### Go back to [README](../../README.md).
###### Go back to [reference](../reference.md).

There are different ways to control the program's flow.

`if's` test whether the topmost value of the stack is `true`. If yes, the if-scope is entered. 
Scopes are ended by using the keyword `end`.

<style>p{color:red;}</style>
<p>hello world</p>
